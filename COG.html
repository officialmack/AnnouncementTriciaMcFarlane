		<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2> 
		
				<p>In the poverty-stricken favelas of Rio de Janeiro in the 1970s, two young men choose different paths. Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) is a budding photographer who documents the increasing drug-related violence of his neighborhood. Jos&eacute;  "Z&eacute;" Pequeno (Leandro Firmino da Hora) is an ambitious drug dealer who uses Rocket and his photos as a way to increase his fame as a turf war erupts with his rival, "Knockout Ned" (Seu Jorge). The film was shot on location in Rio's poorest neighborhoods. 
				<br><br>
 The film shows the darker side of one of South America's most famous resort cities, Rio de Janeiro. Set in the "City of God," the lawless ghetto where the city's poorest and most dangerous citizens live, Meirelles tells stories of hope, of violence, and of love. The movie tells the origin of Li'l Z&eacute;, a killer with serious self-loathing issues. Fernando Meirelles spins his tale, as well as others, with hyperkinetic editing, handheld cameras, and sun-soaked lighting. The effect is Scorsese-esque and thrilling, but City of God also manages to skirt glorifying the violence.
